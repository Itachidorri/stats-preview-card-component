## Overview

This goal of this project is to develop a simple webpage having a Stats preview card component and styling it using whatever I've learned so far in my front-end web development journey. It is also to provide useful resources that I found to be helpful during my learning journey for fellow newbie learners.

## My process
1. Build the html structure for the project using the given design as reference.
2. Figure out elements that need to be responsive and map out the structure where flexbox is needed.
3. Transform block level elements to flex containers & flex items using a custom utility class 'flex'.
4. Figure out similarly styled elements and define custom properties to take control of the elements. These are defined at the top of the CSS file which allows you to put all of the controls to your webpage at the top which makes it easy to edit the CSS file.
5. Style the webpage in a cascading manner.
6. Finding solution to design & errors on resources such as 'google,'w3schools','stackoverflow'.
7. Implementing solutions.


### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- [CSS font stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) - For font stacks, this shows the applicability of fonts in windows and mac OS.


### What I learned

Styling page cleverly using CSS properties:
1. Using flexbox - Very useful to build responsive webpages. Resource to learn fundamentals of Flexbox from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU. Explained very well.

2. Using custom properties - Make changes to your CSS files with ease, it's a must learn if you want to write CSS that can be easily maintained & also up your CSS game.

3. Making images responsive - Used properties 'object-fit' and 'object-position' to make images responsive.
